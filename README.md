## Introduction
Hello! Welcome to the MentalBook! This was created by a single developer, who's known as "Pengu1n".
Pengu1n started to make a Project called, **MentalApp** for his therapy sessions, but he put so much time and energy into this, he wanted to upload it to GitHub!
The **MentalApp** Project started way back in September of 2025, where he really didn't know exactly how to code this.
In the first week, he started to learn about using **String Methods**
By the first month, he had already written 2000 lines of code!
However, by that point, he realized that if he wanted to add anything, it would be very time consuming, since everything was pretty much in one Java file.
Unfortunately, by December 12th, 2025, he stopped updating or adding the project, and by January 18th, 2026, he considered it a **Dead Project**.
But, on February 8th, 2026, he created a new project called, **MentalBook**.
He has been creating a ton of new files, organized everything into those files.
